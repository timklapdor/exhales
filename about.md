Exhales is an attempt at a couple of things:

1. Using Github & Jekyll to create forkable content (check markdown in "_posts" folder).
2. Getting ideas out - even if they are half-formed, incorrect, badly worded.

Words and Images are available for use as CC BY NC except images that are attributed - in which case follow the link for attribution and usage terms. Feedback is always welcome and appreciated. 

I also have an accompanying blog - *[Inhales](http://inhal.es)* which is full of curated snippets from the web. 

This is definately a work in progress, and something that will evolve over time. 

Stay tuned. 

Cheers,
