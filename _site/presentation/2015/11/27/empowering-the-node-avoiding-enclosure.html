<p><img src="http://exhal.es/assets/article_images/empowering-the-node/dLRN_Page_01.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Today I wanted to present on two things - one is an observation of a significant problem. The other is to put forward a proposal for a way forward in which to overcome.</p>

<h3>The problem</h3>

<p><img src="http://exhal.es/assets/article_images/empowering-the-node/dLRN_Page_02.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>I want to introduce this term of Enclosure to describe what I think has been happening on the web since the emergence of social media.</p>

<p><img src="http://exhal.es/assets/article_images/empowering-the-node/dLRN_Page_03.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Enclosure is a term from the Agricultural revolution and it&#39;s used to descibe the process that ended the ancient system of farming in open fields. Rather than individual farmlands there was the commons and everyone had a right to farm in the commons.</p>

<p><img src="http://exhal.es/assets/article_images/empowering-the-node/dLRN_Page_04.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Enclosure was the process of putting up fences on the commons and moving ownership of  property from the community into private hands. This process generated massive social and economic change. To the power dynamics, social structures and the levels of individual and community autonomy. It created new classes of people and an economic and social structure that relied on exploitation.</p>

<p><img src="http://exhal.es/assets/article_images/empowering-the-node/dLRN_Page_05.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>In many ways this is what I see happening in today’s digital networks? A case of history repeating itself.</p>

<p>The original concept of the web was that we all would have our own websites. These would be our own place to create, store and publish. We would create a &quot;commons&quot; in which we share knowledge. And that through this digital network a social space would emerge out of this big open system.</p>

<p><img src="http://exhal.es/assets/article_images/empowering-the-node/dLRN_Page_06.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>The web was designed to be distributed. A network without a central point of failure or control. In this way nodes could connect in a multitude of different ways, networks would emerge in independant and evolving ways able to be reshaped to suit the needs of the time.</p>

<p><img src="http://exhal.es/assets/article_images/empowering-the-node/dLRN_Page_07.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>But today&#39;s digital networks are built on systems that look like this. Centralised around a single database. A single point of failure. A single point of observation. A database able to be harnessed for commercial interests and effects. And while the number of nodes that these systems can support is amazing, they operate in isolation. A node in Facebook cannot connect to the one on Twitter. A node in the LMS cannot connect with LinkedIn. This is regardless of whether that node is the same person or not. By simply using these systems we are forced to create multiple identities.</p>

<p><img src="http://exhal.es/assets/article_images/empowering-the-node/dLRN_Page_08.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>We have moved to a model where we essentialy put our stuff into other peoples containers. We&#39;ve given up it seems on the open  spaces. Where once we shared, the fences have now been put up. Fences that keep  the ability for us and our data to connect and be shared - separate and contained.</p>

<p><img src="http://exhal.es/assets/article_images/empowering-the-node/dLRN_Page_09.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>We put our photos on flickr, our resume on LinkedIn, our personal lives on Facebook, our location on Foursquare. And from that point on the data doesn’t live in the commons. It doesn’t even live in our own domain it goes into these silos. We become renters of our own information. We become nodes not in a network of our own, but in someone elses.</p>

<p>And it&#39;s not just in how we use these networks that encloses our data. These businesses also have a variety of practices that they often exploit:</p>

<p><img src="http://exhal.es/assets/article_images/empowering-the-node/dLRN_Page_10.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p><strong>Acquisition of data</strong> – where the actual system of startups and venture capital actual promote a culture of build and sell out. The strategy becomes accumulation of users and associated data which becomes the assest used to leverage a</p>

<p><img src="http://exhal.es/assets/article_images/empowering-the-node/dLRN_Page_11.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p><strong>Binary choice</strong> – signup to these networks is limited two options -  accept or decline. There is no way to negotiate terms, understand them or choose licensing options before you sign up.</p>

<p><img src="http://exhal.es/assets/article_images/empowering-the-node/dLRN_Page_12.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p><strong>Licencing and ownership of digital objects</strong> - when we sign up to the terms of service quite often what we are doing is granting that company a perpetual licence to use our data. It&#39;s not granting them ownership - but in a digital rather than analogue world, what is the difference?</p>

<p><img src="http://exhal.es/assets/article_images/empowering-the-node/dLRN_Page_13.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p><strong>Proprietary formats</strong> - And finally, by creating proprietry formats our data often becomes locked in to their system. This means that there is little portability of our data - we can&#39;t move it between networks, it becomes anchored to a single system which in many ways is defeats the purpose of being digital!</p>

<p><img src="http://exhal.es/assets/article_images/empowering-the-node/dLRN_Page_14.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Another way to think about this enclosure is outlined in the Hacker Manifesto that was written by McKenzie Wark back in 2004, important to note that this was before the rise of social media. In the book Wark suggested that what was occurring was the rise of a Vectoralist Class - the owners of the vectors - the various pathways and networks over which information flows.</p>

<p><img src="http://exhal.es/assets/article_images/empowering-the-node/dLRN_Page_15.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>In a nod to Marx, rather than owning the means of productions the Vectoralists own and exploit the means of transmission. They may own the wires and the cables, but increasingly they own the platforms through which we consume and share.</p>

<p><img src="http://exhal.es/assets/article_images/empowering-the-node/dLRN_Page_16.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>The Vectoralists commidify information. They exploit information as a resource for capital. Our information, our data, becomes the commodity that they trade with. We are being exploited in order for them to make a profit. &quot;Our&quot; digital networks feed these commericial concerns.</p>

<p><img src="http://exhal.es/assets/article_images/empowering-the-node/dLRN_Page_17.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>This is perhaps the best example of how the Vectoralist model isn&#39;t a theory, it&#39;s become reality.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Uber, the world’s largest taxi company, owns no vehicles. Facebook, the world’s most popular media owner, creates no content... And Airbnb, the world’s largest accommodation provider, owns no real estate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>-<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/03/03/in-the-age-of-disintermediation-the-battle-is-all-for-the-customer-interface/">Tom Goodwin</a></p>

<p><img src="http://exhal.es/assets/article_images/empowering-the-node/dLRN_Page_18.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Power and money has shifted to those who can connect.</p>

<p><img src="http://exhal.es/assets/article_images/empowering-the-node/dLRN_Page_19.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>These are the valuation on these networks:</p>

<p>Facebook valuation $US250 billion July 2015
Uber valued at more than $US50 Billion July 2015
AirBnB valued at over $25 billion</p>

<p>So our data and the networks that it travels through are incredibly vauable. In many ways too valuable. Too valuable to be comdified.</p>

<p><img src="http://exhal.es/assets/article_images/empowering-the-node/dLRN_Page_20.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Too valuable to be trusted to these younger, hipper fat cats who are driven by a profit motive.</p>

<p><img src="http://exhal.es/assets/article_images/empowering-the-node/dLRN_Page_21.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>How do we avoid enclosure &amp; stop the rise of the vectoralists?</p>

<h1>The Proposition - Empowering the Node</h1>

<p><img src="http://exhal.es/assets/article_images/empowering-the-node/dLRN_Page_22.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>The common element in any network are the nodes. The individuals that make up the network, and it&#39;s important to think of them as people - not as users. And people should have the right to be free and autonomous on the web just as they are in life.</p>

<p>The solution is not the creation of new networks or alternative to Facebook or Twitter. As Mike suggested - getting away from the stream and think more about the garden.</p>

<p>We need to move beyond the creation of networks as data containers which can be commodified and commercialised.</p>

<p><img src="http://exhal.es/assets/article_images/empowering-the-node/dLRN_Page_23.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Instead we need to focus on developing systems, tools and methods that empowered the node. Ways that allow each node to establish control over their digital lives.</p>

<p>To provide individuals the power to negotiate their networks and move seamlessly between them.</p>

<p>To smash the silos and the surveillance, to not just reclaim our domain but to extend it with the ability to generate new networks of our own.</p>

<p><img src="http://exhal.es/assets/article_images/empowering-the-node/dLRN_Page_24.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>We need a new model that supports a quite different approach to social, economic, political and technological issues in the digital space.</p>

<p><img src="http://exhal.es/assets/article_images/empowering-the-node/dLRN_Page_25.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>And whats interesting is that there are a range of emerging technologies and practices that provide a glimpse into how this could happen.</p>

<p>Concepts like federation, APIs and the blockchain provide an insight into how all this could work. You may not understand what all of these things are - but understand that there are people in the tech world who are working at reshaping the available technologies.</p>

<p>And it&#39;s something I am interested in pursuing because I think it&#39;s an opportunity to reimagine networks - how they are created, how they are governed and for those of us at this conference - how they can be used to learn and grow and change.</p>

<p><img src="http://exhal.es/assets/article_images/empowering-the-node/dLRN_Page_26.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>The idea that I&#39;ve been fleshing out over the last 6 months or so is MYOS.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a multi-purpose accronym that is an attempt to encapsulate how this might work and how we could create it.</p>

<p><img src="http://exhal.es/assets/article_images/empowering-the-node/dLRN_Page_27.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p><strong>Mind your own stuff</strong>.</p>

<p>At it&#39;s heart is the concept of a domain. Building on the work that Jim Groom and his team have been working towards we need to start with having a space, a store and a server to do this all on. But the focus of MYOS is to think beyond our own space, and to look at how we might connect woith others. How might we create our networks.</p>

<p><img src="http://exhal.es/assets/article_images/empowering-the-node/dLRN_Page_28.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p><strong>Make your own space</strong>.</p>

<p>What if we could reimagine Facebook, Twitter and the LMS as spaces for networks rather than the containers of them? What would be possible then? What could we do if we could negotiate our own terms, to move beyond the binary of accept or decline. Part of myos would be that it would be quite simple and easy to create our own networks without the need for the massive overhead of server infrastructure and centralised management.</p>

<p><img src="http://exhal.es/assets/article_images/empowering-the-node/dLRN_Page_29.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p><strong>My online self</strong>.</p>

<p>As people we are multifaceted. We have different aspects to our lives, we take on different personas, we socialise with different groups. We need technology that can support a better understanding of ourselves as complex human beings rather than data in a table. We need to be able manage our identity online, not have it defined by LinkedIn or Facebook. We shouldn&#39;t have to manage complex privacy settings that are open to change at any moment. We shouldn&#39;t have to fill in another online form so our personal information can yet again be held in  another database.</p>

<p><img src="http://exhal.es/assets/article_images/empowering-the-node/dLRN_Page_30.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p><strong>My operating system</strong>.</p>

<p>And what if we could make this as simple to run as your phone? By developing a backend structure that combined hardware and software you could add new features in much the same way you install an app.</p>

<p><img src="http://exhal.es/assets/article_images/empowering-the-node/dLRN_Page_31.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>We could add in a variety of features:</p>

<p>A way to manage your identity, your memberships, your personal records, display your badges and qualifications, share your publications, create galleries of images, develop a portfolio of your work, or collect your notes.</p>

<p>The idea would be to create something adaptable to the individual, supportive of your own needs,</p>

<p><img src="http://exhal.es/assets/article_images/empowering-the-node/dLRN_Page_32.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>What I call all of this is Nodeware - A combination of hardware and software that can change the underlying structure of systems from centralised to decentralised. From institutional to individual. From controlled to free. From closed to open. Something that allows us to create <a href="http://hapgood.us/2015/10/17/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral/">Mike Caulfield&#39;s Garden</a>. </p>

<p>MYOS embodies the following priciples to Empower the Node:</p>

<p><img src="http://exhal.es/assets/article_images/empowering-the-node/dLRN_Page_33.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>1) You are in control - that as a node you get to make the decisions, they&#39;re not made for you.</p>

<p><img src="http://exhal.es/assets/article_images/empowering-the-node/dLRN_Page_34.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>2) Data is yours - your data is sovereign and it should be treated that way. You should have authority over how your data is shared and used. Who can access it and for how long.</p>

<p><img src="http://exhal.es/assets/article_images/empowering-the-node/dLRN_Page_35.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>3) Connections are negotiated - rather than simply sign away to terms of service we need to ensure that democratic values are not lost. Networks require trust to work effectively so it&#39;s importatnt that both sides are explicit about what and how they are willing to work. Systems</p>

<p><img src="http://exhal.es/assets/article_images/empowering-the-node/dLRN_Page_36.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>4) Enhance and enable diversity - Rather than enforce a monoculture, MYOS aims to promote diversity. We live in a complex world and we need to service that complexity rather than limit and While there is a need for a stable core, MYOS should promote a diverse eco-system of applications.</p>

<p><img src="http://exhal.es/assets/article_images/empowering-the-node/dLRN_Page_37.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>If we are gathered here today to discuss digital learning networks then we acknowledge that they are incredibly useful and meaningful. But we must also accept that the networks that we currently use are limited because of the underlying models and the technologies that support them.</p>

<p><img src="http://exhal.es/assets/article_images/empowering-the-node/dLRN_Page_38.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>We need to change the model and change the mindset. To become distributed, to be more co-opertative, to promotoe more autonomy and ultimately be more connected.</p>

<p><img src="http://exhal.es/assets/article_images/empowering-the-node/dLRN_Page_39.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>To  not just create new vectors, but create a new commons.</p>

<p><img src="http://exhal.es/assets/article_images/empowering-the-node/dLRN_Page_40.jpg" alt=""></p>
